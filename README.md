# Optimizing-Metro-Move-Solutions-Operations
I performed An Exploratory Data analysis of Metro Move solutions through Machine learning to understand their trip performance, passengers behavior, fare patterns and other factors needed to optimize their operations and make data driven decisions.
## Skills Utilized
In this analysis, data cleaning and raw data preprocessing, data visualization, data explorations, descriptive statistics, univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed to make effective decisions.
# To make effective decisions, it is neccessary to
•Understand passenger usage patterns.
•Evaluate the performance of different transport modes.
•Analyze how trip characteristics impact customer experience.
# Result of the analysis
## How days of the week affect Mode of transport
Tram has the highest passenger count on Fridays which is the most travelled day followed by the Ferry which happenes on thursdays
the train has the lowest passenger count on sundays
On Mondays, the train has the highest passenger count
while passenger counts has begun to reduce for Ferry, Bus and Train, it has started to peak for the Tram
## Correllation performance between the passenger count, total amount, trip duration and fare amount and Results
There is a strong correllation between passenger count and Total amount at 0.66,
this means passenger count determines the total amount.
There is a weak negative correlation of -0.04 between fare amount and trip duration,
this means Trip duration doesnt really determine fare amount or has no influence on fare amount.
there is a weak positive correlation of 0.02 between trip duration and passenger count. This means is a slight relationship between trip duration in minutes and passenger count, trip duration determines slightly the number of passengers.
# Reccommendations
Tram mode of transportation should be made more effective as it accounts for the most used during the week due to its short distance and path.
pricing adjustment that better reflects operational costs tied to trip duration should be considered because it seems that the fare amount does not align with the pricing logic.
Trip duration can be reduced when shorter routes are determined by Metro Move solutions operations in order to increase the number of passengers 
Promotions or service enhancements that encourage higher passenger numbers per trip should be considered, because this is directly tied to revenue.
